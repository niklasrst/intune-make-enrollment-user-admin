# üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Make Enrollment User local Admin üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

This script can be deployed through Microsoft Intune to an Windows device to make the enrollment user a local administrator on the device. Similar to the option in Windows Autopilot but with this you can change the user level anytime later in the same way.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Intune
- Managed Windows Client

## How to?

Create a .INTUNEWIN from this repo and deploy it as an app in Microsoft Intune
Then upload it like this to your Intune environment and assign it to a group of users which should become local admin on their devices - they need to have them enrolled so that the detection can match.

### Program setup
